# Java Backend

This was my first Java [Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) project. It has a simple [@Controller](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Controller.html) class to serve templates manipulated with [Thymeleaf](https://www.thymeleaf.org/). The backend accesses a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database to get data and send it to the frontend. Originally hosted at [render.com](https://render.com/) for a free month ([https://javabackend-p50n.onrender.com/](https://javabackend-p50n.onrender.com/)).
